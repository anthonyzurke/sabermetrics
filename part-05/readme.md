## Overview

Time to present!  You will be doing two presentations: a non-technical and a technical.  Assume a different audience for each... in other words, don't assume that if you mention something in one presentation, the audience already knows it in your second....



## REQUIREMENTS - NON-TECH: 4 mins

1. 4 minutes (no longer!) presentation for a non-technical audience.
   - Don't use jargon!  Imagine your stakeholders are not data savvy.
   - Don't just deliver the information; tell a story about the problem and solution

2. Make sure you cover the following areas:
   - Goals
   - Success Criteria / Metrics
   - Overall approach
   - Findings
   - Risks/Limitations
   - Impact, next steps, conclusions

## REQUIREMENTS - TECH: 10 mins

1. 10 minutes (no longer!) presentation for a technical audience.
   - Again, don't just deliver the information; tell a story about the problem and solution

2. Make sure you cover the following areas:
   - Goals
   - Success Criteria / Metrics
   - Data
   - Overall Approach
   - Basic description of model(s)
   - Findings
   - Risks/Limitations
   - Impact, next steps, conclusions

3. Be prepared to answer questions / justify your approach.
